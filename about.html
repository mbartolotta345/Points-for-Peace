                Our Goal
            </div>
            One of the largest and fastest-growing concerns in the world today is the deteriorating state of our environment. 
            Issues such as global warming, climate change, and pollution decrease our quality of life and show no signs of improving in the future. 
            To solve this problem, people need to take greater initiative and take action against these issues by being more environmentally friendly in their day-to-day lives. 
            Many people choose not to take any action to save the environment because the effects of environmental problems never directly affect them throughout their
             day. If people were incentivized to make environmentally friendly decisions, the environmental issues could be significantly reduced, which is the goal of
              our app. By creating a social media platform where users can show off how they help the environment and be rewarded for their actions, we can promote
               progress towards a world free of the environmental problems that affect our world today.

            This site allows users to show off how they're doing to help promote healthier
            and cleaner environments. Users can post photos of their accomplishments for other users to see.
            Posts can be viewed from the home page, and users can like or leave comments on posts if they want
            to. To incentivize users to post, users will gain points for every like they get on their posts. 
            These points can be redeemed in the rewards section for different prizes, encouraging users to 
            create posts that will gain them as many likes as possible. By creating a space where people are
            sharing their achievements in helping the environment and being rewarded for it, we hope
            to bring communities together through their efforts to save the environment.
