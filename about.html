                Our Goal
            </div>
            One of the largest and fastest growing concerns in the world today is the
            deteriorating state of our environment. Issues such as global warming, climate change, 
            and pollution decrease our quality of life and show no signs of improving
            in the future. In order to solve this problem, there needs to be a greater initiative
            of people taking action against these issues by being more environmentally friendly 
            in their day to day lives. The reason many people choose not to take any actions in saving
            the environment is because the effects of environmental issues are never directly
            affecting them throughout their day. If people were given more of an incentive to make
            environmentally friendly decisions, the enviornmental issues can be significantly reduced,
            which is the goal of our app. By creating a social media platform where users can show off 
            how they help the environment and be rewarded for their actions, we can promote progress
            towards a world free of the environmental problems that affect our world today.

            This site offers users the ability to show off how what they're doing to help promote a healthier
            and cleaner environments. Users can post photos of their accomplishments for other users to see.
            Posts can be viewed from the home page and users can like or leave comments on posts if they want
            to. To incentivise users to post, users will gain points for every like they get on their posts. 
            These points can be redeemed in the rewards section for different prizes, encouraging users to 
            create posts that will gain them as many likes as possible. By creating a space where people are
            sharing their achievements in helping the environment and are also being rewarded for it, we hope
            to bring communities together through their efforts to save the environment.
